# URC
I have made the two required web page and I have set up how I would like it 
to be structure. I am not sure how much color changing and editing we were 
suppose to do by this assignemnt so I didnt really focus on that. I purely 
focus on how the assignment made it sound which was to figure out how we 
want to display those two page(opportunities and details). Ofcourse there 
are things that will be added as I continue working on it. 
The Opportunity page will display the research project by the Proffesor name 
and then below it will show a picutre of the professor some information such 
as the name, the field, requirement and a picture whatever the prof. chooses.
Once you click on the link page, I will keep a similar structure but another big 
box with all the details about the research. Next to that box will be images of 
either the workplace, the team you will work with or something to do with research.
